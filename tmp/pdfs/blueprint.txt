1. Executive Summary
This document defines a complete, multi-tenant church management SaaS that includes:





A Church Admin web portal (operations, members, finance, communications, reporting)
A Super Admin portal (platform oversight, subscriptions, support, compliance)
A public church website builder (per church, with custom domains)
A Flutter mobile app ecosystem connected to the same backend (staff + optional member app)

The system is designed for modern UX, strong tenant isolation, structured workflows, and scalable
subscriptions. It uses TypeScript, React/Next.js, Tailwind, Prisma, SQL, Docker, Flutter, and Firebase
(Auth/FCM/Analytics).

1.1 Goals





Enable churches to run day-to-day operations in a structured way (members, services, groups, events,
giving, reports).
Provide a website builder and publishing pipeline so each church can launch a modern website quickly.
Offer a Flutter mobile experience that complements web usage (attendance, follow-ups, notifications,
dashboards).
Give the platform owner (Super Admin) full oversight: tenant governance, billing, usage analytics,
security, and support.

1.2 Non-Goals (for Phase 1)




Full double-entry accounting and payroll (we start with finance-lite; deep accounting can be Phase 3).
Streaming infrastructure (we integrate embeds from existing platforms first; native streaming can be
later).
Highly custom bespoke website development per church (we focus on templates + modular blocks).

1.3 Success Metrics (KPIs)






Activation: % of new churches completing onboarding and recording first service within 7 days.
Weekly Active Churches (WAC) and Staff Active Users (DAU/WAU).
Retention: 30/60/90-day retention by plan tier.
Revenue: MRR, churn, upgrade/downgrade rate, average revenue per church (ARPC).
Operational value: average time to capture visitors and generate weekly report.

2. Users, Roles, and Portals
2.1 Portals
Super Admin Portal: Platform owner console to manage all churches, plans, billing, feature flags, audits, and
support.
Church Admin Portal: Tenant portal for church staff to manage operations and content.

3

Public Church Website: Public-facing site generated per tenant (subdomain + custom domain).
Flutter Mobile Apps: Staff app (leaders/treasurers/check-in). Optional member app (profile, giving, events).

2.2 Default roles within a church (RBAC)
Role

Typical Permissions

Church Owner

Full access, billing ownership, security settings.

Admin

Operational administration, members, events,
services, website content.

Pastor/Leader

Member care, follow-ups, attendance, reports
(limited settings).

Treasurer

Giving, pledges, budgets, finance reports.

Secretary

Announcements, events, registries, schedules.

Group Leader

Only their assigned groups and group attendance.

Custom roles can be created per church by enabling permissions at module/action level (view, create, edit,
delete, export, approve).

2.3 Permissions model (recommended)
Use a consistent permission key pattern:







module.action.scope
members.view.any, members.edit.any, members.export.any
attendance.checkin, attendance.reports.view
giving.create, giving.approve, giving.export
website.pages.edit, website.publish, website.domains.manage
admin.impersonate (Super Admin only)

3. End-to-End Product Flow
3.1 Church signup & onboarding (tenant creation)

6. Technical Architecture
6.1 Stack selection (your requested stack)
Layer

Technology

Web (Church Admin + Super Admin + Websites)

Next.js (React + TypeScript) with App Router,
Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui component system.

Backend API

Node.js TypeScript service (NestJS recommended
for structure) exposing REST APIs (OpenAPI) for
web and Flutter.

ORM

Prisma for schema, migrations, and typed data
access.

Database

PostgreSQL (recommended) or MySQL.
PostgreSQL preferred for reporting, JSON fields,
and indexing.

Auth + Mobile services

Firebase Authentication for identity, FCM for
push, Crashlytics/Analytics for mobile telemetry.

Infra

Docker + docker-compose for local/dev;
containerized deployments for staging/prod.

6.2 High-level system diagram (textual)
Client layer → Edge routing → Web apps → API services → Data & integrations:
Flutter (Staff/Member) | Browser (Church Admin / Super Admin) | Public Website Visitors
↓
↓
↓
Firebase Auth (Identity) + FCM (Push) — shared identity layer
↓
API Gateway / Backend (NestJS) — rate-limits, RBAC, audit logs
↓
PostgreSQL (tenant data) + Redis (cache/queues) + Object Storage (media)
↓
Payments (Stripe/Paystack/Flutterwave), Email/SMS Providers, Analytics

6.3 Backend service structure (recommended)





Monorepo (pnpm/turborepo): apps/web, apps/api, packages/ui, packages/shared, apps/mobile
(Flutter separate repo).
API modules: auth, tenants, members, services, attendance, giving, website, messaging, admin.
Background jobs: imports/exports, email/SMS sending, weekly report generation, billing webhooks.
API contract: OpenAPI + generated clients for web and Flutter.

6.4 Multi-tenancy strategy
Start with a shared database and shared schema, using a strict tenant_id discriminator on every multitenant table. Every API request resolves a tenant context (from subdomain, custom domain, or explicit
tenant selection) and enforces isolation through query filters and authorization checks.





Tenant resolution sources:
Admin portals: user is linked to one or more tenants; active tenant is selected after login.
Public websites: tenant is resolved from subdomain/custom domain in the request host header.
Mobile apps: tenant is selected during onboarding or staff invite acceptance; stored in app state.

6.5 Authentication and backend security model





Flutter/Web uses Firebase Auth to sign in and receives an ID token (JWT).
Backend verifies the Firebase ID token on every request, then loads the platform user + church role
permissions.
Sensitive actions create audit log records (who, what, tenant, timestamp, IP/device).
Rate limiting for auth endpoints and messaging endpoints to prevent abuse.

6.6 Data storage and media strategy





Relational data in PostgreSQL (members, attendance, giving, events, website config).
Media assets (photos, sermon files) stored in object storage; store URLs/metadata in SQL.
CDN caching for public websites and media for fast global access.
Plan-based quotas for storage, plus add-ons.

6.7 Website builder architecture
Website pages are stored as structured content (JSON blocks) tied to a tenant. Next.js renders these
blocks server-side for SEO and performance. Publishing is immediate, with caching and invalidation for
scale.





Template system: prebuilt sections (hero, ministries grid, service times, giving CTA, sermon list).
Theme tokens: colors, typography, spacing stored per tenant.
Custom domain: DNS verification + automated certificate provisioning in production hosting
environment.
Forms pipeline: spam protection, notifications to staff, exports.

6.8 Deployment and environments






Local dev: docker-compose for Postgres + Redis + local S3-compatible storage (optional).
Staging: one environment per branch or shared staging; seeded demo tenant.
Production: separate DB, separate storage bucket, isolated secrets.
CI/CD: build + test + lint; deploy web and api containers; run Prisma migrations safely.
Backups: automated daily DB backups with retention policy.

Future integrations: Google Calendar sync, WhatsApp Business, accounting exports.

9. UI/UX System
9.1 Design principles



Clean, modern, mobile-first layouts with consistent spacing and typography.
Fast workflows for weekly operations: check-in, visitor capture, follow-up creation, report export.
16




Role-based navigation: users only see what they can access.
Accessibility: contrast, keyboard navigation (web), scalable text (mobile).

9.2 Web UI framework choices
Use Tailwind CSS for styling and a high-quality component system for consistent UI. Recommended:
shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) as the base component layer, extended with a design system.







UI components to standardize:
Data tables (filters, sorting, exports, bulk actions)
Forms (validation, steps/wizards, autosave)
Dashboards (cards, charts, insights)
Modals, drawers, toasts, command palette
Empty states, onboarding, paywall/upgrade prompts

9.3 Flutter UI strategy





Material 3 with custom theming (brand tokens aligned with web).
Reusable widgets for forms, lists, and charts.
Push-driven workflows for follow-ups and reminders.
Deep links from notifications into exact screens (e.g., follow-up task).

10. Security, Privacy, and Compliance







Tenant isolation enforced at the API layer and in database queries.
Least-privilege access with RBAC and secure defaults.
Audit logging for sensitive actions: finance edits, member exports, role changes, impersonation.
Encryption in transit (HTTPS). Store secrets in managed secret store in production.
Rate limiting for auth and messaging endpoints; CAPTCHA on signup (Phase 2).
Data export and deletion workflows per tenant (admin-controlled).

10.1 Data backups and retention





Daily automated backups with 30–90 days retention (depending on plan).
Restore procedures tested monthly (Super Admin responsibility).
Data retention policy for cancelled tenants (e.g., 60–180 days) before hard delete.
Export: tenant admins can export members, giving, attendance at any time.

11. Delivery Plan (Sprints & Milestones)
We will build in phases to keep quality high while delivering usable value early. Below is a recommended
roadmap that still keeps the full system design holistic from day one.
